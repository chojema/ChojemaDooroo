/**
 * The generate hand-off (8.5): "make" leaves the request for the new tab, and
 * the editor in that tab takes it — once.
 *
 * - A request is queued for one webContents (the new tab's) and can be taken
 *   only by that webContents and only for the kind it was made for. The first
 *   take empties the slot; a second take, a reload, another tab or another
 *   kind gets null. Nothing here starts a run: the taking editor starts it
 *   through its own send gate, with the provider chosen as usual.
 * - A tab that closes before taking drops its request.
 * - The editor reports "a run started in this tab with at least one handed-over
 *   material attached"; the event is kept in memory (tab, sources, mode) for
 *   a later reader. Nothing is written to disk.
 * - A conversion without AI (8.6) involves no hand-off: the shell opens the
 *   new tab with the result and records "converted into this tab, from these
 *   sources" here (`recordGenerateConverted`, read with
 *   `generateConvertedEvents`), for the same reader.
 *
 * - The skill hand-off (spec 5.6, 5.7) uses the same one-take slot rules for
 *   any of the eight editors: a template copy opened in a new tab takes the
 *   person's request with its skill chips (and, for the template preview, the
 *   pending skill proposal) and runs it through that tab's own send gate. It
 *   sits beside the generate hand-off: each kind is taken only by its own take.
 *
 * No Electron import: the shell queues through it and the editor mains
 * (bundled into the shell) import it to register their own
 * `<editor>:handoff-take` channel; the tests run it as is. The store sits on a `Symbol.for` key so every bundled
 * copy of this module shares one (the same reason as unsaved-files.ts).
